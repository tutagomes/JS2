> **Chrome V8**, or simply **V8**, is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) [JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine) developed by The Chromium Project for [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) and [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) web browsers.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8#cite_note-comic-5) The project’s creator is [Lars Bak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Bak_(computer_programmer)).[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8#cite_note-6) The first version of the V8 engine was released at the same time as the first version of Chrome: September 2, 2008. It has also been used in [Couchbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couchbase), [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) and [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) that are used server-side.

> V8 [compiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) directly to native [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) before executing it, instead of more traditional techniques such as [interpreting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) or compiling the whole program to machine code and executing it from a filesystem. The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime, based on heuristics of the code's execution profile. Optimization techniques used include [inlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlining), [elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_elision) of expensive runtime properties, and [inline caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching). The [garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) is a [generational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Generational_GC_(ephemeral_GC)) [incremental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Stop-the-world_vs._incremental_vs._concurrent) collector.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8#cite_note-7)

> V8 can compile to [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_architecture), [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) or [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) [instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) in both their 32- and 64-bit editions; as well, it has been ported to [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC)[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8#cite_note-8) and [IBM s390](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ESA/390)[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8#cite_note-9)[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8#cite_note-10) for use in servers.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8#cite_note-google_dev-3)[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8#cite_note-11)

Antes de instalar o gerenciador de pacotes Node, é preciso instalar o próprio Node.
