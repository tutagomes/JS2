# Funções =>

After reading the preceding paragraph, did you try to count how many ways there are to define a function in JS? There are actually far more than you probably think, including at least the following:

- *A named function declaration*: function one(...) {...}
- *An anonymous function expression*: var two = function(...) {...}
- *A named function expression*: var three = function someName(...) {...}
- *An immediately-invoked expression*: var four = (function() { ...; return function(...) {...}; })()
- *A function constructor*: var five = new Function(...)
- *The new style, an arrow function*: var six = (...) => {...}
