# Formatando com Prettier

Se você trabalha em um projeto com muitos outros desenvolvedores, mais cedo ou mais tarde haverá discussões sobre como o código deverá ser formatado. É possível que vocês cheguem a um padrão, mas a medida que o código vai crescendo e as "manias" de cada um vão se apresentando, manter um padrão fica mais difícil.

O problema é agravado pelo fato de que aplicações JS modernas incluem muito mais do que JS, passando também por TypeScript, Flow, JSX, JSON, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Stylus e muitas outras.

> After having tried out many source code formatters, I finally decided to use Prettier for all purposes. Prettier is an *opinionated* code formatter, which supports all the languages that I listed previously, reformatting source code according to a set of rules, thus ensuring that all code conforms to an expected style.

Vamos ver como o Prettier se comporta trabalhando com arrow functions. Caso a função tenha apenas um parâmetro, parênteses são opcionais:

```
const plus1= (x)=> 1+x
```

Ao executar Prettier, ele 'decide' que os parênteses não são necessários, além de adicionar espaços para facilitar o entendimento e a clareza do comando. Além disso, ele também adiciona um ponto e vírgula ao final:

```
const plus1 = x => 1 + x;
```

Se você utiliza `promises`, utilizando JS, você pode escrever algo do tipo::

```
fetch('http://some.url').then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  }).then((myJson) => {
    console.log(myJson);
  }).catch(e => { /* something wrong */ });
```

E se você executar o Prettier, é bem provável que ele acabe da forma:

```
fetch("http://some.url")
    .then(response => {
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(myJson => {
        console.log(myJson);
    })
    .catch(e => {
        /* something wrong */
    });
```

Note how each .then(...) was pushed to a separate line, according to the most common style for JS. The formatting rules that Prettier applies are derived from usual practice, and it wouldn't be possible to list them all here. But, what really matters is that by using this tool, you may be certain that your whole team will be working in the same fashion.

If your team grumbles about some rule or other, remind them of the saying *there's a right way, a wrong way, and the Army way!* After adopting Prettier, there will be no place for style discussions any more, and peace will eventually reign.



# How to do it…

Installing Prettier is very simple: you should just add the VSC extension, which you can find by searching for Prettier Code Formatter; as a check, the latest version (as of December, 2018) is 1.16.0, and the author is Esben Petersen. The plugin itself can be found in the VSC marketplace, at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode. You can also install it globally (as we saw in the *Installing packages for different purposes* section earlier in this chapter) to be able to use it in scripts or from the command line with npm or yarn. See https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html, and I'd recommend doing that.

There is one change you will want to make in the VSC preferences. Go to File | Preferences | Settings, and add the following line to your user configuration, so every file will be formatted automatically whenever you save it:

```
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
.
.
.
```

If you'd rather only apply Prettier to JS, then you should use this instead:

```
"[javascript]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
},
.
.
.
```

As we said, Prettier is pretty opinionated as to how code should look, and there are only a few options that you can change. The available options can be set in package.json (which makes it easier for all the team to share them) in a "prettier" key. Some of the possibilities (meaning the ones you might want to modify) are as follows:

| **Option**         | **Default value** | **Meaning**                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| arrowParens        | false             | For arrow functions with a single parameter, whether to enclose it in parentheses. |
| bracketSpacing     | true              | Include a space after the opening brace of an object, and before the closing brace. |
| jsxBracketSameLine | false             | If true, the ending > for a multiline JSX element will be added at the end of the last line; if false, it will be on a separate line. |
| printWidth         | 80                | Maximum line size.                                           |
| semi               | true              | Add semicolons at the end of every line, even if not needed. |
| singleQuote        | false             | Use single quotes for strings.                               |
| tabWidth           | 2                 | Indentation size.                                            |
| trailingComma      | none              | Specify whether to add trailing commas or not, wherever possible. Options are none (never add such commas), es5 (add them where ES5 allows, as in arrays or objects), or all (add them even to function arguments). |
| useTabs            | false             | Use tabs for indentation.                                    |

 

Personally, the only ones I use are tabWidth:4 and printWidth:75, but the latter is for the sake of the book only, not for other work. My package.json thus includes the following; I have it just before the dependencieskey, but you can place it elsewhere:

```
"prettier": {
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "printWidth": 75
},
.
.
.
```


You can also use Prettier independently of VSC, and in that case the configuration options should go in a .prettierrc file. See https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html and https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html for more on this.

Finally, if you want to avoid Prettier code formatting for some reason or another, you can do the following:

- Avoid all formatting for a given file by adding its path and name to a .prettierignore text file at the project root
- Avoid reformatting a single sentence by preceding it with a // prettier-ignore comment

For the latter option, remember to use the appropriate comment style depending on the source code language. For example, in an HTML file's you would use <!-- prettier-ignore -->, while in CSS, it should be /* prettier-ignore */, and for JSX, {/* prettier-ignore */}.

# How it works…

There are two ways of using Prettier. The first is to configure VSC to automatically format the code whenever you save it; following the instructions we saw earlier when we installed VSC, change the editor Format on save option to true, and you'll be set. Of course, you can also format the code whenever you want by right clicking and selecting the Format Document option.

You can also use Prettier online. Go to https://prettier.io/playground/, paste your code into the left panel, and you'll instantly get a formatted version in the right panel. Take a look at the following screenshot for an example of code reformatting:

 Prettier online can be used to experiment with configuration parameters, or for a quick code reformatting session

If you want to experiment with the few available options, click Show Options at the bottom-left corner, and you'll be able to configure Prettier, according to what we saw in the previous section, see the following screenshot:

 If you want to dynamically experiment with (the few available) Prettier settings, you can do so in the online playground

When preparing the code for this book, I set the right margin at 75, because that's what will fit in a printed page. I also set indentation to 4 characters, because I find it clearer. Other than that, I left everything as the default; fewer style arguments to deal with this way!
