# Working with a database

Let's now see how you would access a database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, or more. Accessing a database is frequently done, so that's what we will be doing. I chose some geographical data (with countries, their regions, and the cities in those), to which we'll later add something else, to work with more complex examples.



### Getting ready

Getting a list of countries was easy: I used the data from https://github.com/datasets/country-codes, which I pruned down to just the country two-character code (as in the ISO 3166-1 norm) and name. For regions and cities, I used GeoNames' data from http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/; in particular, I used admin1CodesASCII.txt, which I reworked into regions.csv, and cities15000.zip, which I edited into cities.csv.

If you want to be able to view CSV files in a clearer format, check out the EXCEL VIEWER extension for VSC.

What you need to know about these three tables is as follows:

- *Countries* are identified by a two-letter code (such as *UY* for Uruguay, or *IN* for India), and have a name
- *Regions* belong to a country, and are identified by the country code, plus a string; in addition, they have a name
- *Cities* are identified by a numeric code, have a name, latitude and longitude, population, and are in a region of a country

This is enough to get started; later, we will be adding some more tables, to experiment a bit more. I used MariaDB (the open fork of MySQL; see https://mariadb.com/) and MySQL WorkBench (see https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to create the tables and import the data, just because it's even simpler than doing it by hand! I also created a fkereki user, with modernJS!! as the password, to access the tables.



### How to do it…

In order to access a MariaDB database, we will install the mariasql package from https://github.com/mscdex/node-mariasql and then promisify its .query() method, to work in an easier fashion. Installation is accomplished with npm install mariasql --save and, after a short while (you will see some object code being built), the package will be installed. Follow the steps mentioned next.





### Getting a connection

First, let's have some constants that we will be using later; apart from the Flow and strict usage lines, we just require the MariaDB library, the promisify() function, and we define four constants to access the database:

```
// Source file: src/dbaccess.js

/* @flow */
"use strict";

const mariaSQL = require("mariasql");
const { promisify } = require("util");

const DB_HOST = "127.0.0.1";
const DB_USER = "root";
const DB_PASS = "!MyPassword";
const DB_SCHEMA = "world";

// continues...
```



Now, let's get a database connection. We just create a new object, and promisify its .query() method. The dbConn variable will be passed as a parameter to every function that will need to access the database:

```
// ...continued

function getDbConnection(host, user, password, db) {
    const dbConn = new mariaSQL({ host, user, password, db });
    dbConn.query = promisify(dbConn.query);
    return dbConn;
}

const dbConn = getDbConnection(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_SCHEMA);

// continues...
```



### Executing some queries

A simple way of testing if the connection works is by executing a trivial query that returns a constant value; what really matters here is that the function should work without throwing any exceptions. We use await to get the result of the .query() method, that is an array with all the found rows; in this case, the array will obviously have a single row:

```
// ...continued

async function tryDbAccess(dbConn) {
    try {
        const rows = await dbConn.query("SELECT 1960 AS someYear");
        console.log(`Year was ${rows[0].someYear}`);
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("Unexpected error", e);
    }
}

// continues...
```

Let's try something else: what about finding the ten countries that have more cities? We can use .forEach() to list the results in a frankly not-very-attractive format:

```
// ...continued

async function get10CountriesWithMoreCities(dbConn) {
    try {
        const myQuery = `SELECT 
            CI.countryCode, 
            CO.countryName, 
            COUNT(*) as countCities
        FROM cities CI JOIN countries CO 
        ON CI.countryCode=CO.countryCode
        GROUP BY 1 
        ORDER BY 3 DESC 
        LIMIT 10`;

        const rows = await dbConn.query(myQuery);
        rows.forEach(r =>
            console.log(r.countryCode, r.countryName, r.countCities)
        );
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("Unexpected error", e);
    }
}

// continues...
```



### Updating the database

Finally, let's do some updates. We will first add a new (invented!) country; we will then check whether it exists; we will update it and check the changes, then we will proceed to delete it, and finally we'll verify that it's gone:

```
// ...continued

async function addSeekAndDeleteCountry(dbConn) {
    try {
        const code = "42";
        const name = "DOUGLASADAMSLAND";

        /*
            1. Add the new country via a prepared insert statement
        */
        const prepInsert = dbConn.prepare(
            "INSERT INTO countries (countryCode, countryName) VALUES (:code, :name)"
        );
        const preppedInsert = prepInsert({ code, name });
        await dbConn.query(preppedInsert);

        /*
            2. Seek the recently added country, return an array of objects
        */
        const getAdams = `SELECT * FROM countries WHERE countryCode="${code}"`;
        const adams = await dbConn.query(getAdams);
        console.log(
            adams.length,
            adams[0].countryCode,
            adams[0].countryName
        );

        /*
            3. Update the country, but using placeholders
        */
        await dbConn.query(
            `UPDATE countries SET countryName=? WHERE countryCode=?`,
            ["NEW NAME", code]
        );

        /*
           4. Check the new data, but returning an array of arrays instead
        */
        const adams2 = await dbConn.query(
            `SELECT * FROM countries WHERE countryCode=?`,
            [code],
            { useArray: true }
        );
        console.log(adams2.length, adams2[0][0], adams2[0][1]);

        /*
            5. Drop the new country
        */
        await dbConn.query(`DELETE FROM countries WHERE countryCode="42"`);

        /*
            6. Verify that the country is no more
        */
        const adams3 = await dbConn.query(getAdams);
        console.log(adams3.length);
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("Unexpected error", e);
    }
}

// continues...
```



### Getting everything together

All we have to do now, to get a complete working example, is just call the three functions:

```
// ...continued

tryDbAccess(dbConn);
get10CountriesWithMoreCities(dbConn);
addSeekAndDeleteCountry(dbConn);
```

Finally, I added a script to automate running all tests, by doing npm run start-db:

```
"scripts": {
    "build": "flow-remove-types src/ -d out/",
    "buildWithMaps": "flow-remove-types src/ -d out/ --pretty --sourcemaps",
    "start": "npm run build && node out/doroundmath.js",
    "start-db": "npm run build && node out/dbaccess.js",
    .
    .
    .
},
```

Let's analyze how the code works, and remark on some interesting points.



### How it works…

Running tryDbAccess() isn't hard to figure out: the constant query goes to the server, and an array with a single row comes back. The output of our code would have been as follows:

```
Year was 1960
```

The second query gets more interesting. Apart from the details of actually writing the SQL query (which is beyond the objectives of this book) the interesting point is the returned array, each with an object with the selected fields:

```
IN India 1301
BR Brazil 1203
RU Russian Federation 1090
DE Germany 1061
CN China 810
FR France 633
ES Spain 616
JP Japan 605
IT Italy 575
MX Mexico 556
```



Now, let's get to the last example. We are seeing several ways of creating the statement that will be executed.

The INSERT uses a prepared statement. A good way to prepare safe queries (meaning, they cannot be involved in SQL injection hacks) is by using prepared strings. The .prepare() method is interesting: given a string, it returns a function, that when called with the actual parameters to use, will itself return the string to use in the query. Of course, you can also build the function by hand, as I did in the other examples—but then it's up to you to make sure that the resulting query is safe! 

The .escape() method can help building a safe query string, if you don't want to use .prepare(). See more at https://github.com/mscdex/node-mariasql.

The subsequent SELECT uses a string created by hand (nothing too original here) but the UPDATE shows another style: using ? symbols as *placeholders*. In that case, you must also provide an array of values that will replace the placeholders; it's fundamental that the order of the values in the array matches the expected arguments. 

Next, the second SELECT also uses placeholders, but adds a tweak: passing an object with the useArray:trueoption, the function performs a tad faster, because it doesn't create objects for each row, and simply returns arrays. This has a problem, however, because now you have to remember what each position of the array means. 

The results of the code are as expected: first a single line, showing that a country was actually created, with the values we passed; then, the same record but with a changed name, and finally a zero showing that the country doesn't exist any more:

```
1 '42' 'DOUGLASADAMSLAND'
1 '42' 'NEW NAME'
0
```
